1. create a new date time -> whenever user runs simulation, it runs based on current time
2. Upsample data for every second. used pandas interpolation - it is just copying all the new timestamps - do we need more than that ?
3. Centralized architecture - may be later can be extended for distributed one 
4. ignoring transient energy specified in energy consumption. since with variable sampling rate , duty cycle is bit tricky concept and we dont need it now
